{"name":"3sm","tagline":"Simple System Suspend Manager","body":"# 3SM: Simple System Suspend Manager.\r\n\r\n![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfjhh/3SM.svg?branch=master)\r\n\r\nUsed to change system state (often to suspend or hibernate) on low battery at a\r\nspecified percentage.\r\n\r\nOn my system, this program runs via an entry in root's\r\n[`crontab(5)`](http://linux.die.net/man/5/crontab) file:\r\n\r\n    @reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmS 3SM /usr/local/bin/3sm d 15\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou should be able to do a standard install with `./configure && make && make\r\ninstall`, but only after `configure`, `Makefile`, and others are created. You\r\nwill first need to have the Autotools installed, and run `autoreconf -i`.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nRequires root privileges to run.\r\nEither run `3sm <args>` as root or do `sudo 3sm <args>`.\r\n\r\nAvailable kernel sleep states are:\r\n *\t'f' => 'freeze'.\r\n *\t's' => 'standby'.\r\n *\t'm' => 'mem'.\r\n *\t'd' => 'disk'.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of these may not exist on your system. Find out what is available\r\nby issuing `cat /sys/power/state`. `3sm` will not allow an attempt to execute a\r\nstate that does not exist.\r\n\r\nStates are substituted with their\r\n[`pm-action (8)`](http://linux.die.net/man/8/pm-action)\r\ncounterparts if they exist, instead of just the raw state change.\r\n\r\nDocumentation on these modes can be found\r\n[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt).\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n\t# to suspend to disk on 10% battery.\r\n\t$ 3sm d 10\r\n\r\n\t# to freeze at 40%, and run as a daemon.\r\n\t$ 3sm f 40 &> /dev/null &\r\n\r\n\t# suspend to ram at `pi`%.\r\n\t$ 3sm m 3.14\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
